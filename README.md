# Springboard-Introduction-to-Data-Science---Capstone-Project
Capstone Project Proposal

1. Boston Housing Project 
This data set is often used as an introductory project for many of data science and machine learning at various educational institutions. 
I have personally used this data set for one of my school projects in the past, but I would like to get another opportunity to takcle
this data set using different tools and methods to predict the Boston House Prices, preferably using R, Tableau, and Python. 

Pros - Easily accessible, many completed models available for help, suitable for beginners like myself, medium database

Cons - It would be difficult for me to come up with original ideas and findings

2. Personnel Trends by Ranking/Gender/Race in US Military
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/personnel-trends-by-gender-race
This data set is provided by DOD which shows ranking, gender, and race by each branch of the US military. I would be interested to find 
out if either gender and race shows any strong relationship with ranking in the military, and possibly finding the reason behind it. 

Pros - original, interesting topic which can be shared with others, personal interst in military and defense industry, beginner level

Cons - small dataset which limits the use of the tools (2 pages (Active and Reserve) consists of A-Z columns and 1500 rows

3. OFFICIAL DIR Cooperative Contract Sales Data Fiscal 2010 To Present
https://data.texas.gov/Business-and-Economy/OFFICIAL-DIR-Cooperative-Contract-Sales-Data-Fisca/w64c-ndf7
2.59 GB data from state of Texas where I recently became a resident in. This data set shows purchase history from vendors from 
pulbic entities within Texas from 2010 - present. I would be interested to find out who are top 5 vendors and potential cost savings
without compromising or slightly downgrading a quality if Texas were to switch it over to other vendors. 

Pros - Big Data!!!, Must use R to run this file, many interesting insights which can potentially save money

Cons - Never dealt with big data in the past, cannot use Access or Excel, can be overwhelming
