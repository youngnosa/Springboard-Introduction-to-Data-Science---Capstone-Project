Project Proposal

I want to help solving lowering the suicidal rate in the state with the highest suicidal rate combining three different outside factors: 
average income and cost of living ratio by states, average annual sunlight by states, and population densities by states. My focused 
clients are states those currently are experiencing high suicidal rates. My clients can use the outcome of this data to come up with 
assistance programs for residents whose are in needs and come up with a predict model that can predict individuals who are more 
susceptible to these specific conditions. I was able to acquire these datas using various government websites. During the project, 
I will be go through 5 different phases: obtain, scrub, explore, model, and interpret. I will be heavily rely on excel and R Studio 
to obtain and scrub data, and planning to use tableau to interpret my results. My deliverables will include simplified datasets, graphs, 
chart, and case report.
