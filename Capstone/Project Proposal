__Project Proposal__

Combining three different outside factors: 
Cost of Living Index by states, Average Annual Sunlight by States, and Population Densities by States. 

My focused client is Wyoming Department of Health: Prevention and Health Promotion Unit, PHPU. According to Wyoming Department of Healthâ€™s website (https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/prevention/wivpp/suicide-prevention/), the state has been very actively involved with many different programs including Suicide Prevention Training, Suicide Survivor & Lived Experience Support Groups, Mental Health Professionals, and etc in order to lower the suicidal rate. 

My client can utilize the outcome of this data to support current assistance programs and even come up with new assistance programs for the residents of Wyoming. I am hoping to come up with a predictive model that can identify the correlationship between suicidal rate and any possible outside factors including living index, average annual sunlight by states, population density, and etc, then predict what the suicidal rate is going to be next 5 years if these outside factors are not managed properly.
I was able to acquire these data using various government, state, and public .org sites:

During the project, I will be go through 5 different phases: obtain, scrub, explore, model, and interpret. I will be utilizing Excel, R Studio to obtain and scrub data, and planning to use tableau to interpret my results. My deliverables will include simplified datasets, predictive model, data analysis, graphs, chart, and case report.
